1. HTML ANATOMY!!!!!
HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content. Let’s take a look at how they’re written.

The diagram to the right displays an HTML paragraph element. As we can see, the paragraph element is made up of:

An opening tag (<p>)
The content (“Hello World!” text)
A closing tag (</p>)
A tag and the content between it is called an HTML element. There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.

Let’s quickly review each part of the element pictured:

HTML element (or simply, element) — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

HTML Tag — the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle bracket.

Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.

Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.

  EJEMPLO!!!
  <p>Hello world!</p>
  

  2. HTML BODY!!!!!!
EJEMPLO!!
  <body>
  <p>que pasa, chavales!</p>  //TODO LO QUE VA ENTRE <p> y </p>, SALE POR CONSOLA!
  </body>

  3. HTML STRUCTURE!!!
  <h1>texto</h1>= cabecera del texto
  <h2>texto</h2>= cabecera mas pequeña
  <h3>texto</h3>= cabecera aun mas pequeña (si sigues poniendo h3 debajo, el tamaño es el mismo)
  <h4>texto</h4>= cabecera aun mas pequeña
     
    EJEMPLO!!
    <body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>This paragraph is a child of the body element</p>
  <div><p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element</p>
    

    4. DIVS!!!
    One of the most popular elements in HTML is the <div> element. <div> is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful for grouping elements in your HTML together.

<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Why use divs?</h1>
    <p>Great for grouping elements!</p>
  </div>
</body>

<div>s don’t inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML elements. <div>s allow us to group HTML elements to apply the same styles for all HTML elements inside. We can also style the <div> element as a whole. You can see how this can be done in the Learn CSS course.

<div>s can contain any text or other HTML elements, such as links, images, or videos. Remember to always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of <div>s for better readability.
