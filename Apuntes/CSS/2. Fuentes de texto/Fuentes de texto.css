Throughout this lesson, you learned concepts including:

- The font-family property defines the typeface of an element.
- font-size controls the size of text displayed.
- font-weight defines how thin or thick text is displayed.
- The text-align property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.
- Text can have two different color attributes: color and background-color. color defines the color of the text, while background-color defines the color behind the text.
- CSS can make an element transparent with the opacity property.
- CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the background-image property.
- The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.
