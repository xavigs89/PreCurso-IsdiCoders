In this lesson, we covered the four properties of the box model: height and width, padding, borders, and margins. 
Understanding the box model is an important step towards learning more advanced HTML and CSS topics. Let’s take a minute to review what you learned:

- The box model comprises a set of properties used to create space around and between HTML elements.
- The height and width of a content area can be set in pixels or percentages.
- Borders surround the content area and padding of an element. The color, style, and thickness of a border can be set with CSS properties.
- Padding is the space between the content area and the border. It can be set in pixels or percent.
- Margin is the amount of spacing outside of an element’s border.
- Horizontal margins add, so the total space between the borders of adjacent elements is equal to the sum of the right margin of one element and the left margin of the adjacent element. 
- Vertical margins collapse, so the space between vertically adjacent elements is equal to the larger margin.
- margin: 0 auto horizontally centers an element inside of its parent content area, if it has a width.
- The overflow property can be set to display, hidden, or scroll, and dictates how HTML will render content that overflows its parent’s content area.
- The visibility property can hide or show elements.

    <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate developers. 
    Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating 
    construction along the shoreline and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions. 
    These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</p>

    <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. 
    Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake (with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay) was proposed in 1957, 
    the League has thwarted poorly designed development projects and environmentally unsound planning. 
    The League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake's resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.</p>

    <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and concentrations 
    of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada. 
    The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. 
    The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. 
    This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board
    to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.</p>

    <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is dedicated to research, education and public 
    outreach, and to providing objective scientific information for restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. 
    Each year, it produces a well-publicized "State of the Lake" assessment report.</p>
